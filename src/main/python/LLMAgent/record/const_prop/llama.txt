system: You are a professional static analysis assistant, please analyze the source code for constant propagation based on the style of the following samples.source code:void constant2(boolean b) {    int x;    if (b) {        x = 10;    }    int y = x;}You need to give the result in the following form:result:{variable1 = value1, variable2 = value2, ...},in which value can be data or NAC.for the example above, the result should be:{b=NAC, x=10, y=10}

user: analyze the source code for constant propagation.source code:void constant1(boolean b) {    int x = 2;    int y = 2;    int z;    if (b) {        z = x + y;    } else {        z = x * y;    }    int n = z;}

assistant: After analyzing the source code, I found that there are some opportunities for constant propagation.

Here's the analysis:

1. `int x = 2;` and `int y = 2;` are assigned constant values, so we can propagate these values to `z`.
2. In the `if` branch, `z = x + y;` is assigned a constant value, which is `2 + 2 = 4`.
3. In the `else` branch, `z = x * y;` is assigned a constant value, which is `2 * 2 = 4`.
4. Since both branches assign the same constant value to `z`, we can propagate this value to `n`.

Here's the result of constant propagation:

`result: {b=NAC, x=2, y=2, z=4, n=4}`

user: analyze the source code for constant propagation.source code:void assign() {    int x = 1, y;    x = 2;    x = 3;    x = 4;    y = x;}

assistant: After analyzing the source code, I found that there are some opportunities for constant propagation.

Here's the analysis:

1. `int x = 1;` is assigned a constant value, but it's immediately overwritten by `x = 2;`, so we can't propagate the original value.
2. However, `x = 2;` is assigned a constant value, but it's immediately overwritten by `x = 3;`, so we can't propagate this value either.
3. Finally, `x = 4;` is assigned a constant value, and this value is used to assign `y = x;`, so we can propagate this value to `y`.

Here's the result of constant propagation:

`result: {x=4, y=4}`

user: analyze the source code for constant propagation.source code:static void NAC(int p) {    int x;    if (p > 0) {        x = 1;    } else {        x = 2;    }    int y = x;}

assistant: After analyzing the source code, I found that there are some opportunities for constant propagation.

Here's the analysis:

1. `int x;` is declared but not initialized, so we can't propagate any value yet.
2. In the `if` branch, `x = 1;` is assigned a constant value, but we can't propagate this value because the `else` branch might be taken.
3. In the `else` branch, `x = 2;` is assigned a constant value, but we can't propagate this value because the `if` branch might be taken.
4. However, since `x` is assigned a value in both branches, we can determine that `x` is always assigned one of two constant values, depending on the value of `p`.
5. Since `p` is a parameter and not a constant, we can't determine its value at compile-time, so `x` is still a NAC (Non-Arithmetic Constant) expression.
6. However, since `x` is assigned a value in both branches, we can propagate the constant values to `y`, but `y` is still a NAC expression because its value depends on the value of `p`.

Here's the result of constant propagation:

`result: {p=NAC, x=NAC, y=NAC}`

system:  You are a professional static analysis assistant, please analyze the source code for constant propagation based on the style of the following samples. source code: void constant2(boolean b) {     int x;     if (b) {         x = 10;         }         int y = x; } You need to give the result in the following form: result: {variable1 = value1, variable2 = value2, ...},in which value can be data or NAC. for the example above, the result should be:{b=NAC, x=10, y=10} when source code contain more than one function, you should do constant propagation for each function and consider interprocedural situation. For example, for following source code source code: int cake(int i){     int k = i+10         return k; } int const(){     return 10; } void good(){         int x = 5;         int y = cake(x);         int z = cake(const()); } You need to give the result in the following form: result: >>function1:{variable1 = value1, variable2 = value2, ...} >>function2:{variable1 = value1, variable2 = value2, ...} ...... for the example above, the result should be: result: >>cake:{i=NAC, temp$0=10, k=NAC} >>const:{temp$0=10} >>good:{x=5, y=15, z=20} analyze each query first and make sure to keep explaination short
