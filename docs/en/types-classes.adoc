= How to Specify and Access Types, Classes, and Class Members (Methods and Fields)
Java programs are built using types and classes, which consist of class members such as methods and fields.
Tai-e assigns a unique identifier, known as a signature, to each type, class, and class member.
These signatures enable users to easily configure and specify the behavior of program analyzers for specific elements, such as in taint configuration (see <<taint-analysis#,How to Use Taint Analysis?>>).
Additionally, they allow analysis developers to easily retrieve and manipulate program elements through Tai-e's convenient APIs.

In some cases, it may be necessary to specify _a large number_ of classes or class members within a configuration or when implementing a particular program analysis.
To streamline this process, we have designed and implemented signature wildcards, which allow you to specify multiple classes and class members using a single wildcard signature.

This documentation will guide you through the format of signatures for types, classes, and class members, as well as the APIs for accessing these program elements via their signatures.

NOTE: Since generic types are erased in Java, type signatures, along with class and class member signatures, *do not include type parameters*.

== Type Signatures
In this section, we introduce the signatures for various Java types, including primitive types, reference types, and the `void` type.

=== Primitive Types
The signatures for the eight Java primitive types are simply their names: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`.

=== Reference Types
Java reference types include class types (encompassing interfaces and enums) and array types.
The signature formats for these types are outlined below.

==== Class Types (Including Interfaces and Enums)
The signature for a class type is its fully-qualified class name, which includes the package name.
For an inner class, insert a `$` between the outer class name and the inner class name.
Here are some examples:

* `java.lang.String`
* `pascal.taie.Main`
* `org.example.MyClass`
* `java.util.Map$Entry`

==== Array Types
An array type signature consists of its base type followed by one or more `[]`, with the number of `[]` indicating the array's dimensions.
Here are some examples:

* `java.lang.String[]`
* `org.example.MyClass[][]`
* `char[]`

=== Void Type
The signature for the void type is simply void. This appears in <<Method Signature,Method Signature>> for methods that do not return a value.

=== Obtain A Type via Signature Programmatically
For analysis developers, `World.get().getTypeSystem()`

== Class and Class Member Signatures

=== Class Signature
* unsurprisingly, exactly same as class type signature.

=== Method Signature

* constructor
* class initializer

=== Field Signature

=== Obtain A Class or Member via Signature Programmatically

== Signature Wildcard
