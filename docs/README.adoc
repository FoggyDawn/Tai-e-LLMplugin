The docs project produces the Tai-e reference documentation.

To generate the documentation, it is usually recommended to execute the following command in the root directory of your project:

```shell
./gradlew :docs:asciidoctor
./gradlew :docs:asciidoctorPdf
```

The generated documentation will be located in `./docs/build/docs/asciidoc/` and `./docs/build/docs/asciidocPdf`.
